# RBX Documentation Search

Creates a new [release](https://github.com/Sleitnick/rbx-doc-search/releases/latest) every day (unless the source repo hasn't changed). The release contains a `files_metadata.json` file, which contains metadata regarding all articles within Roblox's [Creator Docs](https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs) repo.

This data will eventually be used directly to feed the existing [Roblox DevHub Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roblox-devhub-search/mejgpalbcgoooijaoomkcmcjeihhlehf) browser extension.
